    "The Terry Traffic Stops project aims to unravel the complex dynamics behind police decisions during traffic stops, particularly focusing on whether an arrest is made. Building on the legal precedent set by Terry v. Ohio, which introduced the concept of \"reasonable suspicion,\" the project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of arrest following a stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a rich dataset that includes details such as the stop’s context, demographics, and circumstances, the model seeks to identify patterns and key factors influencing these critical decisions. Beyond understanding police behavior, the project aspires to inform policy, promote fairness, and enhance transparency in law enforcement practices. Through this analysis, the Terry Traffic Stops project contributes to the broader conversation on policing and civil rights."

    "Terry Stops, rooted in the principle of “reasonable suspicion,” allow police officers to temporarily detain individuals for investigation. However, the decision to escalate a stop to an arrest can be influenced by a variety of factors, some of which may not be immediately clear or consistent. This project seeks to address the complexities involved in these critical decisions through a multifaceted approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Key Factors**: The project aims to determine the primary factors that influence whether an arrest is made following a Terry Stop. These factors could range from situational elements, such as time and location, to individual characteristics, including behavior and demeanor during the stop. Understanding these variables is crucial for identifying patterns and ensuring that decisions are made based on objective criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive Modeling**: To systematically analyze these factors, the project will develop a binary classification model capable of predicting the likelihood of an arrest. By leveraging historical data, this model will provide a data-driven approach to anticipate outcomes, allowing law enforcement agencies to understand the potential impact of various factors on arrest decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy Evaluation**: A key focus of the project is to provide insights into the role of demographic factors, such as race and gender, in arrest decisions. By examining these elements, the project will help ensure that arrest decisions are fair and unbiased, fostering greater transparency and addressing ethical concerns in policing practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Allocation**: Understanding the patterns and factors that lead to arrests can also assist law enforcement agencies in better allocating their resources. By identifying areas where arrests are more likely or understanding the circumstances that typically lead to such outcomes, agencies can deploy their personnel more effectively and make informed decisions about training and policy development.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction Accuracy**: How well can we predict whether a traffic stop will occur using factors like location, time of day, and demographic information?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Influences**: Which factors are most important in predicting traffic stops? Are there any surprising trends or patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias and Fairness**: Does the model show any bias in its predictions? For example, does it unfairly target certain groups of drivers more than others?\n"

    "## Data Understanding Overview\n",
    "In this phase, we explore the Terry Traffic Stops dataset to gain insights into the variables that describe police interactions during traffic stops. The dataset includes detailed information on both the individuals stopped and the officers involved, covering demographics, stop outcomes, and geographical data. By examining these features, we aim to identify key factors that influence stop outcomes, assess potential biases, and prepare the data for further analysis and modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subject Age Group**: Categorizes the age of the individual involved in the stop.\n",
    "2. **Subject ID**: Unique identifier for each individual stopped.\n",
    "3. **GO / SC Num**: Case or report number associated with the stop.\n",
    "4. **Terry Stop ID**: Unique identifier for each specific Terry Stop event.\n",
    "5. **Stop Resolution**: Outcome of the stop (e.g., arrest, warning).\n",
    "6. **Weapon Type**: Type of weapon found, if any, during the stop.\n",
    "7. **Officer ID**: Unique identifier for the officer conducting the stop.\n",
    "8. **Officer YOB**: Year of birth of the officer involved in the stop.\n",
    "9. **Officer Gender**: Gender of the officer involved in the stop.\n",
    "10. **Officer Race**: Race of the officer conducting the stop.\n",
    "11. **Subject Perceived Race**: Race of the individual as perceived by the officer.\n",
    "12. **Subject Perceived Gender**: Gender of the individual as perceived by the officer.\n",
    "13. **Reported Date**: Date when the stop was reported.\n",
    "14. **Reported Time**: Time of day when the stop was reported.\n",
    "15. **Initial Call Type**: Reason for the initial call that led to the stop.\n",
    "16. **Final Call Type**: Nature of the call after the stop was resolved.\n",
    "17. **Call Type**: General category of the call or incident.\n",
    "18. **Officer Squad**: The squad or unit to which the officer belongs.\n",
    "19. **Arrest Flag**: Indicator of whether the stop resulted in an arrest.\n",
    "20. **Frisk Flag**: Indicator of whether the individual was frisked during the stop.\n",
    "21. **Precinct**: The police precinct where the stop took place.\n",
    "22. **Sector**: Sub-division within a precinct for geographical analysis.\n",

    "1. Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Terry Traffic Stops dataset contains a comprehensive record of 61,021 police stops. This data is organized across 23 columns, providing a detailed view of each incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset's structure comprises 4 integer columns and 19 object columns. The object columns likely contain strings or mixed data types, allowing for a diverse range of information to be captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While most columns are complete, there are two notable exceptions. The \"Weapon Type\" column has the highest number of null values at 32,565, suggesting that weapon information is not always available or applicable. Additionally, the \"Officer Squad\" column has 561 missing entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Key Column Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 Subject Information\n",
    "The dataset includes details about the subjects of the stops, such as their age group, ID, perceived race, and perceived gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Officer Details\n",
    "Information about the officers conducting the stops is also recorded, including their ID, year of birth (YOB), gender, and race.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Stop Characteristics\n",
    "Each stop is documented with a unique Terry Stop ID, along with the stop resolution and the reported date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4 Location Data\n",
    "The geographic context of each stop is captured through precinct, sector, and beat information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Numerical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Officer YOB\" column provides interesting demographic data about the police force. Birth years range from 1900 to 2002, with a mean of 1984. Both the Subject ID and Terry Stop ID columns show a wide range of values, likely serving as unique identifiers for each entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Categorical Data Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "Several columns offer insights into the nature of the stops and the diversity of those involved:\n",
    "- Stop Resolution has 5 unique categories, indicating various outcomes of the stops.\n",
    "- There are 9 distinct precincts represented in the data.\n",
    "- Officer Race is categorized into 9 groups.\n",
    "- Subject Perceived Race has 11 unique categories, suggesting a detailed approach to recording racial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Flag Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes two flag columns that provide quick reference points:\n",
    "- Arrest Flag is binary, indicating whether an arrest was made.\n",
    "- Frisk Flag has 3 unique values, potentially indicating different levels or types of frisking procedures."

    "### Interpretation of Missing Values in the \"Weapon Type\" Column\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows the mean proportion of missing values in the **Weapon Type** column for each **Precinct**. Here’s what the results imply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Proportion of Missing Values in Some Precincts:**\n",
    "   - **\"-\" Precinct:** About **81.3%** of the rows for this precinct have missing values in the **Weapon Type** column. This is a very high proportion, indicating that most data for this precinct is missing for this feature.\n",
    "   - **\"Unknown\" Precinct:** About **95%** of the data for this precinct is missing in the **Weapon Type** column, suggesting a severe lack of data for this feature in this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate Proportion of Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - **East, North, South Precincts:** Around **50-58%** of the data is missing in the **Weapon Type** column for these precincts, which is a significant amount that might affect the model if these rows are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Low to No Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - **\"FK ERROR\" and \"OOJ\" Precincts:** Both have **0%** missing values, indicating that all data for the **Weapon Type** column is available.\n",
    "   - **\"West\" and \"Southwest\" Precincts:** Have around **37.1% and 46.1%** missing values, respectively, which is still substantial but lower than in other precincts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for the Data and the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Random Missing Data:**  \n",
    "  The varying proportions of missing values across precincts suggest that the missingness is not random. Certain precincts, such as **\"-\"** and **\"Unknown\"**, have a much higher likelihood of missing **Weapon Type** data, which could indicate underlying patterns or data collection issues. Dropping these rows could introduce bias into the model, particularly against precincts with high rates of missing data, potentially leading to skewed predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Bias Introduction:**  \n",
    "  Since missing values are not uniformly distributed, removing them could disproportionately affect the representation of certain precincts. This could reduce the model’s accuracy or fairness by excluding relevant data, especially if **Weapon Type** is an important predictor of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actionable Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imputation Strategy:**  \n",
    "  Consider imputing missing values using a placeholder (\"Unknown\") or filling in based on patterns in the data (e.g., the most common **Weapon Type** within each precinct).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
    "  Create a binary feature indicating whether **Weapon Type** is missing, as this could provide valuable information about the nature of stops in specific precincts.\n"

    "- Percentage of missing data: 0.92%\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Preserving Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "By removing incomplete records, we ensure that all remaining data points have complete information for the 'Officer Squad' variable. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of our analysis, especially if the officer's squad is an important factor in our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Avoiding Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping the rows avoids making potentially incorrect assumptions about the missing data. Methods like imputation or creating a separate 'Unknown' category might introduce bias or noise into our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Simplicity and Transparency\n",

    "This approach is straightforward and easy to explain, enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of our analysis. It doesn't require complex imputation techniques that might be difficult to justify or interpret.\n",

    "### 5. Minimal Impact on Statistical Power\n",

    "Given the large size of our dataset (over 60,000 rows), removing 561 rows is unlikely to significantly reduce the statistical power of our analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Clean Dataset for Analysis\n",
